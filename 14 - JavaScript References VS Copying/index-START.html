    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let main = champion;
    console.log(champion, main);

    champion = 'lux'
    console.log(champion, main);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = "galio"
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    team0 = players.splice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team1 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    team2 = Array.from(players);
    team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'maokai'
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(team0, team1, team2, team4);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    cap1 = Object.assign({}, person, {oui: 0, age:15});
    console.log(person, cap1);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    cap2 = {...person};
    console.log(cap2);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const moi = {
      age: 24,
      name: 'jumaru',
      main: {
        num1: 'shen',
        num2: 'kennen'
      }
    };

    const clone = Object.assign({}, moi);
    console.log(moi, clone);
    // POOR MAN OBJECT COPY/ PROBABLY NOT EFFICIENT
    const clone2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(moi));
    clone2.main.num1 = 'mumu';
    console.log(moi, clone2);
